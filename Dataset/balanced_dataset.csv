Scam!. I purchased 2 $75 gift cards and found out today one of the recipients went to use it and it was declined by Amazon and they accused my family member of fraud.

"It worked with gift card. Ok so, I had a Mastercard gift card type sent by email that could only be used online or with wallet if Apple Pay was accepted (it did not work where Apple Pay WAS accepted once even). It also could only work if purchase did not exceed worth. I had $2 something left on said card and did not know how the bleep I could use it, then I read Amazon will add it to your Amazon balance, where refunds and bonus type moneys are sent. It was relatively easy to do, once I read over the directions for safety sake and figured it out, and there instantly the money transferred to the balance. I think it is used as a default, so I am not positive if it is put back in the balance if it is used and then purchase is returned, but it is my money, so I don’t think that’s an issue. I once got a $5 reward or something from Amazon and when I had to return the purchase, I was not given back that reward they gave me, so I am reticent when it comes to returns and Amazon balances.",4.0,very positive,4

"Great for cashing in Vanilla gifties. The ""Vanilla"" brand gift cards seem to be the most used around here, and I hate that you can't use them in a purchase that doesn't have an exact match with what's on the card. For example, if you have $32.45 left on it, and you buy something totalling $32.46, it will be declined, not allowing you to use two forms of payment. Using them for reloads on Amazon, you can use every last penny, not allowing Vanilla to keep the change.",4.0,very positive,4

It's super simple to track your remaining balance on line, so no need to work at keeping up on your own.  Highly recommended gift for any reader!  Thanks, Amazon, for creating the perfect gift.

You can either download a printed gift certificate to present or have Amazon mail one to your recipient.  Piece of cake!",4.0,very positive,4

"You'll be thirsty and angry. I'm reviewing my most recent experience with a regal gift card, which I received as a gift (no surprise there).<br /><br />I went to see a movie I was excited about, but Regal didn't have it. I picked a different movie that looked interesting because I had this gift card I needed to use. The movie was terrible!<br /><br />I tried to get a large water from the concession stand, but they refused. Apparently you can only buy a large soda. I offered to pay their outrageous soda price with remnant gift card value, but have them fill my large cup with water instead. They refused. So I watched a terrible movie, parched and unhappy.<br /><br />If you're thinking about giving someone this regal gift card, I'd suggest instead giving them $50 and a large glass of water. It's what they really want.",1.0,negative,1

I’m sure they’ll appreciate it more than you telling them, ‘I’m sorry, amazon made a mistake and your gift card is invalid, throw it out. Sorry you have no gift and I can’t afford another.’",0.0,very negative,0
"I couldn’t get the code, customer service made a mistake trying to help.. So I ordered three gift cards for some friends and family. Two ended up staying with me because some family members never bothered to show up. One went to my sister. This particular one.. the sticker for the code would absolutely not peel off. I even tried to scrape it off. I called customer service for help and the lady whom helped me was very nice and helpful. However, she accredited my account all three gift cards, including the one I just gave my sister for Christmas. I did not know this since I am brand new to using amazon and all this stuff. And I only called to get the code for this ONE anyways. Not all three. Now my sisters gift card is completely invalid and I just gave it to her! I wish I could perhaps have it refunded for her. I had no idea when using my gift card, the one that I called about, that hers was applied to my cart at checkout as well! After the holidays I don’t have the money to get my sister another gift card. Hopefully amazon can help refund that for her. I will update if they help. And if they don’t for that matter!.. otherwise it’s a regular gift card. So it’s fine. I’m just fuming at the mistake they cost me.<br /><br />Edit for if anyone from amazon reads this. The woman that helped was incredibly nice and helpful. It was just a communication mistake I believe. But I do hope to get refunded for my one gift card for my sister so she can have her gift. Especially since I called to only get the code for ONE that wouldn’t peel off to reveal the code.",0.0,very negative,0

A credit card without the hidden fees. I have an savings account with an ATM card and sometimes wish that i could get an checking account witch comes with a credit card but trying to avoid the monthly charges that go with it. Now with this gift card i can have a credit card and have zero monthly fees that only a savings account has. I also don't have to worry about someone overcharging me for something that i did not pay for because the card has a fixed amount to it so you can't take all of half of what is in your bank account for an unauthorized transaction.,4.0,very positive,4

"Exactly as described, for better or worse.. These $15 gift cards came with $15 loaded onto them.  While I would have preferred more, I only paid $15 each so I can't complain.  In a perfect world, they each would have had $1,000,000,000 on them.  Then I would have purchased Amazon and instituted a sixth star for reviews that only I could use.  Then I would have to purchase Turbotax from Amazon (I mean, I own the company, I'd probably just have my secretary bring it to me) so I could figure out all my tax issues from receiving $2,999,999,955 in income.  My basis was $45 so don't try to round up to $3B, IRS.  I guess that would equal a lot of tax liability so perhaps I'm glad they just had $15 on them.  Yeah, my life is much better without all the hassles of that money.  Mo' Money, Mo' Problems.",4.0,very positive,4
"Good cards. To be honest, I do not like Build A Bear, but since I already had some gift cards, but not enough to take both of my kids, this was just what I was looking for.  Honestly, $45 is about enough for one kid, because the add-on are numerous, and the store has perfected their sales pitch to children.",4.0,very positive,4
"Gift box was a bit crunched. Card design options that you can select are really nice, I opted for the card / gift box combination when ordered.  Delivery was indeed next day at no additional cost - a real plus.<br /><br />Package arrived in a large mailing envelope with built in bubble wrap but this did not appear to protect the box.  Either handling was really rough or when the card was inserted into the box at Amazon and placed into shipment not a lot of care was exercised.<br /><br />The gift box was meant to be part of the presentation and it detracted from it.  I tried repairs as much as I could and got it to an acceptable condition, just wish it was not necessary.",2.0,neutral,2

"DAMN YOU, NIGERIAN PRINCE!. I was minding my own business here on Amazon, Wu Li Mammoth Sales, when sure as sunrise I get a message from &#34;Amazon dot-com&#34; claiming that they needed my help getting rare mammoth parts out from their former palaces in Nigeria and Niger and I was the only person with all the experience necessary to pull it off.<br /><br />I was skeptical until they told me that we were talking about twenty million dollars of mammoth. Considering my total sales here are tree-fitty a week, I was sold. All Is have to do would be to send $100 to buy a &#34;gift card.&#34; 😉<br /><br />I'm not going to pretend I didn't know what that money was really for. This is baksheesh, the green grease that loosens the gears of bureaucrats and turns away the heads of bumbling cops.<br /><br />I was freaking shocked when instead I got an actual gift card for $105.

EDITED:  after spending  LITERALLY an HOUR on the phone I was credited the $8.  I had to talk to a supervisor,  and they made it sound like they were only giving it to me to shut me up, though.

"Great gift for anyone!. Panera Bread is a bakery and café with locations all across the United States. This is definitely one of those places where there is a little something for everyone. It used to be considered a &#34;hipster&#34; establishment, but is now definitely one that everyone frequents. There is a bakery where you can select fresh-bakes breads, pastries, and other desserts to either take home or snack on in-store in the dining area. You can order from a variety of soups, salads, and sandwiches to enjoy in the spacious dining areas complete with fireplaces and jazzy music. There is a kids menu as well to appeal to the younger crowd. Their lemonades and teas are delicious, especially in the summertime. I usually order a Frontega Chicken Panini with a side of chips and a bottled water to drink and no matter at which location I order it, I am always pleased and satisfied. I recommend this gift card especially as a gift for a college student because each location offers free Wi Fi, so students can be studying on their computers and be hard at work snacking at the same time. This card isn't just good for college students, though. Anyone will enjoy receiving this card because like I said, there's something for everyone. Enjoy!",4.0,very positive,4

"Still hanging fire. I wasn't clear on how to take advantage of this offer, but a free $10 is a free $10. I wasn't sure why I even had a personal ""Gift Card,"" but I followed instructions and added $100, no pain since I was about to make a purchase of almost that. The message I got afterward was to the effect that my deposit would be credited in 5 minutes. After ~ 15 minutes it was still showing 0.00 dollars. So I called. They told me they found me a bit suspicious and they were leaning in on my verification. Might take, say, TWELVE HOURS instead of 5 minutes they confessed. I was just about to make a purchase, so cost me time and aggravation and Amazon a sale. My twelve hours aren't up, yet, but, after reading some of these reviews––wish I'd done that before––I feel a sense of disquiet about the whole thing.",1.0,negative,1

If by mistake you input the wrong email address of the recipient and the gift card is wrongly redeemed, Amazon won't do or tell you anything to stop the payment and won't take any immediate action. All they say is that in a day or two a representative from their gift card office will call you. In the meantime you are short of the money you put in the gift card. There is no warning on their website as to check and double check the recipient's email address at the moment of purchasing in order to avoid fraudulent use of the money you sent.",0.0,very negative,0

"Don't Buy Landry's Gift Cards. My daughter's family sent me a $100.00 Landry's Multibrand Gift Card. She knows I like Mastro's Steak House and she told me to use it at Mastros. The Quick Gift envelope the gift card came in said $100 Mastros Thousand Oaks (CA). In January I dined at Mastro's When the bill came I gave the waiter my Amex Card and the Landry's Multibrand gift card. When the waiter returned he said, ""Landry's hasn't put us on their gift card system yet, so I put the whole amount on your Amex Card"". I asked to speak to the manager. The manager confirmed what the waiter told me. Then asked to see the gift card. I gave it to him and he wnt to a phone and checked the balance. When he came back he said the card had a zero balance. When I got home I called the balance checking number and discovered the card still has a $100.00 balance. i wrote a letter of complaint to Landry's corporate office and followed up with two telephone calls. Landry's never called me back. Yesterday I called two nearby Morton's Steakhouses to see if I could use my gift card at Morton's. In both cases the person on the other end of the phone told me I could not use the gift card at Morton's, because, ""Landry's hasn't put us on their gift card system yet.""",0.0,very negative,0

"Unscrupulous Charges. I usually (won't anymore) upload my VISA gift cards that I receive to Amazon for use online.  I did this with just over $350 last month.  I did a ""Reload"" with this $350.  It was there.  It showed in my account.  With the funds clearly showing I made my purchases that equaled about $355.  When I checked out, the cart clearly, and I repeat CLEARLY showed that $350 would be used from my Amazon Gift Balance and $5 from my debit card.  Well, you guessed it, that did NOT happen.  Amazon whacked my bank card for $355 and refused to find a solution other than putting the money back on the gift cards.  On the surface that seems reasonable but it isn't.  It caused a great hardship for me as it was NOT in my budget to spend $350 out of my checking that way.  Of course the gift cards were again usable but I can't use a gift card to pay my mortgage.  Thanks a lot Amazon for putting the financial squeeze on me.  It was absolutely unacceptable that Amazon wouldn't put the money back into my bank account and figure out how to transfer that transaction to the Gift Balance that I uploaded to Amazon.  I was on the phone for just over one hour with the Amazon representative who was either ruefully ind adequately trained or just plain stupid, not sure which but this situation has me hesitant to even remain as a Prime customer.<br /><br />SHAME ON YOU AMAZON.",0.0,very negative,0

"Very Disappointed. I bought 6 10-packs.  Thought that they would come with gift-card holders or sleeves--you know, the  kind that you can buy at Walgreens for 50 cents each.  When I received the cards without them, I contacted Amazon thinking that they had forgotten to include them.  Their response--an offer of a free box of Mead envelopes!  These gift cards were for clients for X-mas, for gosh sakes.  I ended up having to buy my own at an alternate vendor.  Gift cards are all over the place these days, and most come with some sort of decorative card or holder.  I am very disappointed---probably another choice for me next holiday season!",1.0,negative,1

"Great Gift Card, but would like to choose amount. I got this for some friends of mine who love Pizza Hut. They loved it. I only have one complaint about the gift card here on Amazon, and it's that there isn't a way to choose how much money gets put on the card, as far I was able to find. The thumbnail shows that it's between $20-500, yet I could only pay the flat price of $25. I know other gift card Amazon pages allow you to choose the amount. I'm not sure why this one isn't the same way. Maybe I missed something that wasn't obvious to me, but that's just was I was able to find. Thanks for reading my review of this gift card. I know it's a strange thing to review, because it's just a gift card, but I've reviewed more obscure things, for some reason. Have a great day, and be blessed.",3.0,positive,3
"Not Sure Why I'm Reviewing This. Yep, so this is a feature Amazon has for managing the balance on your Amazon account. I'm not sure why I'm reviewing it, but whatever. Basically, what this does is you can select an amount of money, select a payment method (such as debit card, credit card, or bank) and then Amazon takes that amount out of your bank and puts it into your Amazon Gift Card balance to spend on Amazon. I find this super helpful for whenever I get Visa gift cards. I don't trust those Visa gift cards because I don't bother to read their terms. Some of them take money out of the gift cards if you don't spend it fast enough and other sketchy stuff, so I just load it all straight into my Amazon account (because I totally read their terms). You could also use it for other uses you may think of. Just know that you can't buy everything with Amazon Gift Card balance, such as Amazon Prime or Amazon Pay. Thanks for reading my review, and I hope I could help!",4.0,very positive,4

"First no 2%, now this.  Bad move, Amazon. Amazon is (or was) my favorite place to shop.  I love the prime benefits, and I loved the 2% perk from reloading my card.  Not only has this been eliminated, but now the process is more bogged down, and seemingly not a direct Amazon transaction.  What is the point of reloading?  I liked it because then my individual purchases were only shown by me, like for Christmas shopping.  I would transfer my Christmas shopping budget to gift card balance, then my husband wouldn't see each transaction out of our account and try and guess what I was getting by the amount.  Plus, it kept my checking account transactions uncluttered by many amazon transactions.  This is very disappointing, and for the first time, I'm considering walmart or some other retailer for my substantial Christmas shopping.",0.0,very negative,0

"Great Family Time Together. Bought for my niece and nephew and had a great time. Arrived quickly, and was ready to go. Definitely do your research before you go, and know what you are getting into, so you can buy the right amount, because I saw a lot of reviews about buying the smaller gift card and it not being enough to cover the recipient's purchase. The average Build-A-Bear purchase is going to be $35-$40 per child, if you do an animal and outfit. Of course, $25 is plenty for a low level animal and low level outfit, but kids do not usually gravitate towards the cheap things. In the end, it is what you make it!",4.0,very positive,4

"Beware of packaging. I purchased a $50 gift card and had it sent to a relative. All of the online documentation indicated the recipient would not know what was in the package.  There was a box during the order process for a To: and From: and I also added ""Do Not Open Until Christmas"". The package arrived on the specified day but the label on the outside of the box did not have any indication of my note.  The recipient opened the box to find a sealed Amazon envelope and a packing slip.  The sealed envelope contained the gift card.  I figured the note should be here; nope.  I finally found the note on the packing slip.  OK, that's fine, but the packing slip also had the description of what was inside the sealed envelope including the denomination of the gift card; so much for a surprise.",2.0,neutral,2

SADLY, HE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES, IN VAIN, TO ARRANGE A TICKET FOR TRAVEL FOR LATE MARCH TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT SOUTHWEST AIRLINES DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE GIFT CARD NUMBER AND THEREFORE  COULD NOT HONOR MY GRANDSON'S REQUEST.  I CALLED AMAZON ON MARCH 10TH AND A VERY KIND CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE SAID THEY WOULD NOT REQUIRE THE RETURN OF THE  CARD AND WOULD CREDIT MY ACCOUNT. I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING FURTHER FROM AMAZON REGARDING THIS PROBLEM FOR POSSIBLE REFUND.  SO I HAVE ALERTED, VIA MY REVIEW, FUTURE CLIENTS WHO WISH TO GIFT THESE CARDS NOT TO DO SO UNTIL THE BONA FIDES OF ACI GIFT CARDS, INC BE VERIFIED. BOTH MY GRANDSON AND I ARE UNDERSTANDABLY VERY DISAPPOINTED AND HOPE SOME RESOLUTION WILL BE FORTHCOMING.",0.0,very negative,0

"Mail-in rebate card/ gift card about to expire? Buy Amazon Reload with it.. So basically I bought a product that had a mail-in rebate (where usually you use to get a check. I got a rebate single use credit card, that had an expiration date of 3 months regardless of the remaining balance. Really?! They couldn't just cut a check and let me deposit it.. nope... It was a pain in the neck to get activated. And then they wouldn't let me withdraw it as cash at any ATM or transfer the funds. so yay (sarcastic yay) for the rebate.... After spending too much time of my life on this, I had to follow through and get all my money off this ________ card.<br /><br />I'm tenaciously stubborn, so I searched Amazon for some product that I could spend the entire balance on.  I came across Amazon Reload....<br /><br />Yes! I bought an Amazon Reload for the complete balance of the rebate card. Duh. I also I let out a wicked triumphant cackle because at this point I had to win and I won.<br /><br />Needless to say, mail in rebates with low rewards aren't worth the time, and I won't do it again.<br /><br />But thank you Amazon Reload for helping me claim the balance so I didn't have to worry about it expiring.",3.0,positive,3

Done<br />The gift cards are great when you buy them in person issue here ? Well just don’t buy this one you have to call the main bank to find a card number with a human I could make online purchases but not in person. So my advice ? If you buy a gift card on here two things you should do:<br />Only but the VANILLA gift cards<br />And only the Vanilla at $100<br />Those are the only ones that work as soon as I get them<br />Though I dtk suggest you go online and register it :)<br />I’ve never had any problems with the vanilla gift cards IF they were the $100 ones,0.0,very negative,0

A first for BAD customer service!. I have always had good service with Amazon but this gift card was purchased with the promo desk to get a15$ credit. Well good luck to anyone that can figure that out. I have made several attempts to get help with this and have waisted an hour of my already limited time! They had me try so many processes to get the credit to show on my account and nothing worked. I think it is ridiculous to offer a promotion that does not work and the customer service people were zero help and did not offer any resolution suggestions. So frustrating.,0.0,very negative,0

Horrible Torn/Crumpled Cards. Very disappointed in the half of the11 cards I purchased as gifts . 6 of the card holders and the  gift card itself was torn and or crumpled to the point they could not be used for giving as gifts.

I  only hope that nobody tried to scan the numbers and try to redeem them before our intended recipients receive them.,0.0,very negative,0

You cannot see the serial numbers using the normal screen on your phone.  You need to look on your computer or select Desktop Site on your cell phone. For android select the 3 little dots in the upper right hand corner in the address bar, then select Desktop Site. For iPhone, select the aA in the address bar, then Request Mobile Website.

Attractive Cards. I purchased (10) $150 Amazon Gift Cards as employee rewards.  I chose the White cards (w gold Amazon arrow on the front) and I chose the navy blue envelopes (w the gold Amazon arrow).  This duo made for a classy appearance.  The cards delivered promptly but I had an issue with 1 of them not working.  I contacted Amazon customer service and they quickly solved my problem.  I would recommend these cards to anyone.,3.0,positive,3

"Misleading. None of my cards were damaged but I was very upset to find that what I thought I was activating to give my daughter for Christmas, I was actually redeeming them to put on my Amazon balance. So instead of my daughter receiving them they are on my account. It doesn't say anywhere that that would happen and it's very frustrating because I've been dealing with and issue through Amazon for over a week now I had to contact them again because of this mess.

"Double Charged. Check your existing points and gift card balances at each stage of purchase.

Receipt shows $32 in points used to purchase the card.<br />I get the card apply it to my account. I check check my gift card balance, it shows $32 balance. I think that's weird. No matter I'll look closer in a bit, lets get another gift card. I go to I go to purchase a gift card with points for $28. Receipt shows purchased with points. I go and check my gift card balance, it shows $4. I check the points balance, 4.32. I check the gift card transaction history.<br />For the $32 gift card I was charged $32 in points but the gift card transaction history shows I was also charged 10.96 in gift card balance. $32 card 42.96 cost.<br />I have a $28 gift card on the way. For that card I was charged, $28 in points & $28 from my gift card balance (after I applied the $32 gift card to my account). $28 card, $56 cost.<br />Ending total 4.32 in points, 4 in gift card credit, $28 gift card on the way.

Defective gift cards?. I ordered these gift cards to use for end of the year teacher gifts.  We heard from one teacher that the card did not work/had a zero balance.  Now I am concerned that they may have all been defective.  Is there a way to verify if they have been successfully used?  I do not know the serial number of the card that the teacher received that didn’t work and I don’t want to ask.  Please let me know how to confirm that the cards were valid.  Many thanks.

"Gift Card Blues. What can you say about a gift card? It spends. It works if you can read the numbers (us Baby Boomers need readers for that,) and it's an easy cop-out for those that are hard to buy for. However, come on...the card is hardly pretty to look at...first the orange doesn't go with any of my daughter-in-law's accessories and the black swoop is so passe. I was expecting a little more flair to their gift card. Alas, maybe next year I'll buy a holder with some bling and ditch the boring envelope.  LOL",3.0,positive,3

"Amazon sent two gift cards with a zero balance. I received 2 gift cards, one for $10, one for $20. They were identical, so luckily I went through the Amazon process to check the balances. I'm glad I did because they had sent me two gift cards with a $0 balance. I know they weren't huge gift cards but I would have been so embarrassed handing these out as white elephant gifts not knowing they were empty. I'd advise you to verify your Amazon gift cards have money on them before handing them out as gifts.",0.0,very negative,0

Difficult if you want to add a message. We used Amazon e-gift cards as a prize for fundraising for mid-Michigan flood relief at a golf outing. The message that you can send with the card is limited to 500 characters and you cannot include a website. This is not apparent when ordering. Only when you go to submit the order does it tell you that website addresses are not allowed. Also getting your message in 500 characters is difficult. Next event we may try some other gift card.,0.0,very negative,0

"Never Again: Horrible & Used Looking. I bought 3 gift cards. The first two were fine, but this 3rd one literally looks used. The outer lining had debris, the envelope is ripped, bent, and raggedy. This was supposed to be a gift. I can’t even give this as a gift card because it looks so tacky and torn up. Whoever thought it was okay to ship this was dead wrong for this. Thumbs down.

Amazon GIFT CARD shipping and sorting nightmare !!!. I recently  ordered $3000.00 worth of Amazon gift cards in various denominations. To my horror all of the cards were randomly  thrown in a box with  no dollar amounts written on the cards. I literally  spent over two hours sorting them out by identifying each one by its serial number. How is it possible that Amazon hasn't figured out a better way to do this?,0.0,very negative,0

So I went ahead and purchased the $50 discount card knowing I would receive a $15 discount on my next purchase. When I went to use it today, NOTHING showed up. I was very disappointed and customer service was of no help and didn't offer me anything. The call dropped by accident and they didn't even bother to call me back.

"Wholesome Gift Card. I always loved gift cards as gifts. When you have an uncertainty of what to give your loved one, the easy choice is to give them credit towards their favorite store. My friend absolutely loved the gift card. It came in a nice navy blue, and gold envelope. I then purchased a hallmark card that said, ""I didn't know what to get you, so all I got was this card."" After that, I took some double-sided tape and pasted the gift card on it, and gave it to her. A really magical moment; it is the season of giving.",4.0,very positive,4

"DO NOT BY MULTIPLE GIFTS CARDS AT ONCE!!!. I was tasked to order Amazon Gift cards for our employees - so you can image our dismay when gift cards attempted to be redeemed came back ""invalid"". This would not have been such a big deal if customer service was easy to get a hold of and if they quickly resolved the issue. You cannot talk to anyone directly in the refund department - and they have only partially refunded the gift cards. If you are wanting to get one or two gift cards - go for it - but if it a larger amount, don't do it!!!",0.0,very negative,0

"INSECURE AND PRONE TO THEFT, GIVE CASH INSTEAD. I purchased a $25 Amazon gift card from the Kroger-owned Fred Meyer grocery store in Redmond, WA, and gave it as a gift to my child.  When my child tried to claim the gift card, the gift card had already been claimed by someone else.  The card, once activated, never left our possession and the claim code was not readable from outside the packaging.<br /><br />I presented images of the card and store receipt to Amazon's gift card support.  Amazon knows who claimed the gift card, they know it was not us (""We know for a fact that the gift card has not been redeemed by you.""), and yet they refuse to replace our misappropriated gift card.  Amazon actually told us to file a dispute with our credit card which would result in a charge-back to the merchant that sold their (Amazon's) defective product.<br /><br />Kroger refuses to help as well saying that all gift card sales are final and that it is Amazon's problem.<br /><br />Put simply folks, if you buy an Amazon gift card it is entirely possible that through no fault of yours the funds will be stolen from that card and you will have absolutely no recourse.  None.  Zero.  Zilch.  You lose.<br /><br />HEED MY WARNING:  GIVE CASH INSTEAD.  THE THIEF WILL HAVE TO BREAK INTO YOUR HOUSE OR STEAL YOUR WALLET TO STEAL CASH.  WITH A GIFT CARD THEY CAN STEAL YOUR MONEY FROM THE COMFORT OF THEIR OWN HOME.  EVEN THOUGH AMAZON KNOWS WHO TOOK THE MONEY AND EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW THAT THE PERSON WHO CAN PROVE THEY PURCHASED THE GIFT CARD SAYS THE CARD FUNDS WERE STOLEN, AMAZON WILL NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  AMAZON WILL PROTECT THE THIEF.",0.0,very negative,0

Great way to say “thanks” or show appreciation. When you want to show appreciation or gratitude or say “thanks” to someone but don’t know them well enough on a personal level; the gift card is perfect.

The recipient is happy and it’s easy for me because I don’t have to even leave the house. Recommend highly!,4.0,very positive,4

"Amazon Dropped ball, called customer service - they NEVER called back. Gift Card Cluster. If you think you want to buy assorted values for employee gifts-I bought 50+ for Christmas gifts!  and what a cluster that was- i open the box- and low and behold they are not sorted! All thrown in the box mixed up....So you are saying ""what is the problem-"" well the cards are sealed as gifts and do not show the values. It was like a lottery game.  I found a bar code list of all the different cards and sat there for an hour and sorted numbers (20 digits long) until I had matched all the correct values sorted.  Amazon really never cared.",0.0,very negative,0

"Gift cards and promotions - do not mix!. Original review-<br /><br />I recently bought a $500 gift card of this type to take advantage of the 2019 Prime Day ""Buy More, Get More"" promotion through the Amazon App on my iPhone. Although I carefully followed all terms and conditions of the promotion, the credit didn't appear in the app when it should have. I spent over 3 hours of back and forth with customer service, only to ultimately be rejected for ""not buying through the Amazon App"", which I was very careful to do, but how could I prove that?<br /><br />Meanwhile, others in my exact same situation got their promotional credits with less trouble.<br /><br />Usually Amazon customer service has been great to me in the few times over the years I've had to call them. Maybe I just got bad customer service reps, so I'm writing this review in hopes that someone who won't accuse me of lying will reach out to me about the issue. I'll definitely change this review to reflect anything that happens.<br /><br />Either way though, the only lesson I can take from this whole situation is: do not trust promotions from Amazon (especially ones that involve these gift cards), and definitely don't trust customer service to do the right thing without a bunch of trouble.<br /><br />It seems that Amazon has really changed, and not for the better.<br /><br />EDIT: 7/31/2019<br /><br />So, I just checked the Amazon App (ahem... where I bought this gift card), and when I looked in the notifications, I saw one for the promotional credit I should have gotten, which was credited on 7/30 and which expires on 8/7. I was able to redeem it without a problem. I guess one of the higher ups at Amazon got many (if not all) the affected customers their credits, albeit with only 9 days to redeem them (7/30-8/7) instead of the 12 days they should have had (7/19-7/31).<br /><br />Still though, this whole experience has left a bad taste in my mouth. I understand other customers may be more important than me and therefore they get their problems solved quicker and easier, but the $3000+ I spend on Amazon every year should be worth fixing the most egregious errors like this one, no? And to basically be called either stupid or a liar by customer service, when I'm pointing out clear errors, is kinda inexcusable.<br /><br />3 stars for the problem being finally fixed, but CS and the marketing/promotions team clearly have some work to do.",2.0,neutral,2

"Use a better material for gift cards or package it better.... I received an Amazon gift card as a gift from the company I worked for. It was purchased as this so the initial packaging was done by Amazon. The sticky tac in the envelope was placed right on top of the peel off strip so when I attempted to take it out of the envelope it ripped the strip off the card and caused a surface tear on the card rendering the claim code completely unreadable. Called support only to find that because the code is completely gone there is no other way to redeem this except to contact the individuals who purchased the gift card in the first place to contact Amazon. This is the only company I have seen that uses such a cheap material for their gift cards that this can possibly be a problem. All other companies use actual plastic so this is never an issue. Either don't put the sticky tac on the peel off strip when packaging the gift card, use a better material for the cards that will not be prone to surface tearing, or ditch peel off for scratch off instead. Any option is better than this...",0.0,very negative,0

"cards are fine--special offer didn't work. When I ordered the gift cards for family members, there was an offer to add $15 to my account if I purchased $50 worth of gift cards.  I could not find the credit notation on my account and called customer service for help.  The young woman I spoke with could not find it either so told me that she would add the credit at that time.  I still do not see where the credit is on account and perhaps am not looking in the correct place.  Please check on this to be sure that I should be receiving this credit.  My original purchased noted that the $15 would expire November 16th, 2020.  Thanks.",4.0,very positive,4

"Avoid mini sleeve type Amazon gift cards. I bought a bunch of these mini sleeve type of Amazon gift cards earlier this year.  Package arrived fine and the mini sleeve envelopes looked brand new.  I tried to redeem 3 of them last week and noticed that the orange peel-off sticker strips that normally would cover the redemption code of each gift card were missing...and that someone had already used up those corresponding gift card codes!  It is totally crazy because the envelopes looked new but there is a small window on the back of the sleeve that would allow a scammer to carefully peel off the sticker and read the redemption code.  I am still fighting with Amazon about getting my money back...it's been a pain even though they have the name/info of the account that had fraudulently redeemed my gift cards.  Do yourself a favor, avoid these mini sleeve type gift cards.",0.0,very negative,0

"Amazon Gift Card Purchase Leaves A Lot to be Desired. I read several reviews regarding Amazon Gift Cards, but decided to purchase one anyway.  I wanted to make sure the gift card had a balance before I gave it as a gift, but obtaining balance information was like pulling teeth.  Amazon Chat was absolutely worthless and I only received canned responses to my questions, so I decided to call Amazon Customer Service.  The customer service representative was only a tad bit more helpful than Amazon Chat, and it took the representative over ten minutes to verify that the gift card I purchased had the correct amount loaded onto it.  Listen up Amazon:  There should be a way for customers to confirm that the gift card purchased actually has the correct amount loaded onto it without calling customer service.",0.0,very negative,0

"Give up on the lottery, buy these shims instead. I used to play the lottery three times a week, but then I found these! This gift card is amazing. I got it for a friend to level a wobbly table and it was the perfect thickness. My friend noticed that there was a scratchy lotto game on the back and we went to Amazon to see if we had won. There is a special section under “my account” where you can enter the code. It turns out we won $50, which is exactly what I paid for the leveling device. Since then I have bought about ten more, and all of them were basically a free ticket. We haven’t hit the big one yet, but there’s not a single chair on my block with a rock.  One important thing to note... whether you buy the $25, $50, or $100 version all are the same thickness, so two $25 shims are not the same thickness as a $50 shim, but the prize has consistently matched the price.  If you have a large gap to fill, it would be much more cost efficient to buy small denomination shims.  I’ve started to wallpaper the kid’s room with them now, but am having a hard time finding new things to spend my winnings on.<br /><br />P.S.  The included envelopes are great for fine adjustments but shouldn’t be used in places where moisture may be a problem, like under the fridge.",4.0,very positive,4

"You get exactly what you pay for!. 80k+ reviews on Amazon gift cards already... Not feeling too confident that this will get many views... Sorry, I don't have social media, so sometimes I tend to update my status subliminally within the reviews that I write. Anyhow, what a lifesaver, am I right? This is probably the only thing that you can buy for anyone. For instance, you can't buy a Walmart gift card for just anyone; you can only buy one of those for the people in your life that are actually willing to step inside of one. And be honest; have you ever heard someone say, ""I don't shop at Amazon, too far of a drive for me.""? Of course you haven't! Everyone you know shops at Amazon, probably multiple times a day.<br /><br />Also, it's a life saver for people like me who are awful at remembering important dates (e.g., wife's birthday, wedding anniversary, mother's day, day you first met, anniversary of your first date, first time you held hands, kissed, proposal date, et cetera). So, do what I do, buy a few to have on hand incase you forget to get your wife a gift for one of the aforementioned 'important dates'. It doesn't matter that the two of you share your Amazon account. When she asks, ""Why did you buy five $10 Amazon gift cards while you were in the bathroom?"" Either respond by winking, or telling her that you have a potluck at working coming up.",4.0,very positive,4

"A Total Mess. Make it easier for yourself and get a different gift card. I purchased 50 gift cards and they arrived all jumbled up in the box, with no value on them.

On top of it all, the package was one gift card short. Amazon made it extremely difficult and time consuming for me to go through the cards and cross check if all the correct gift cards had arrived.",1.0,negative,1

"Incredibly difficult to use. I gifted this card to someone and I'm ashamed of how difficult this is to use. It's not connected to the vendors at all and uses like a credit card. What this means is that you can't use this card for anything above exactly the amount (e.g., $50.00) What ends up happening as a result is that you need to use below its value and the company pockets the difference. I'm guessing this is how they make their money. What a shame!",0.0,very negative,0

"Open, Smile. Close, Smile. Open, Close, Smile. Got this for my mailman for Christmas. He was pretty dumbstruck and said it was too much but when I told him it was the only way to get the box he stopped, his face became somber and serious as he slowly said &#34;Good call, bro. Good call&#34;. He even brought the box back to show me and it really is neat because it has magnets holding the box flaps closed almost like a bathroom mirror. It is one of those simple things you could sit and play with just because it is neat and different. Definitely the coolest gift box I have ever seen and my mailman is definitely worth every nickle. Great gift card to the worlds best marketplace.",4.0,very positive,4

When I finally figured it out and tried to charge a dollar less I didn't get my $10 refill bonus that Amazon promised because it wasn't my &#34;first&#34; transaction. What a scam.

"Horrible customer service and can't use giftcard on most hotels. What a horrific &#34;deal.&#34; I bought a $50 giftcard during a lightning deal for $40. I had a specific hotel in mind that I wanted -- when I tried to book it, it said I could only use it on &#34;pay now&#34; hotels. Well, I was paying now... it was a non-refundable room! To use the giftcard I had to book it as a refundable room, increasing the price $20. There was only one other hotel in the area I could use the giftcard for, and it was a dump.<br /><br />I called, thinking surely someone at hotels.com could help me. I called hotels.com. They transferred me to their giftcard distributer, who said they don't make bookings and transferred me to hotels.com again. I could barely understand this guy, and he tried to get me to book and THEN be transferred to customer service. We were almost through booking, and he wanted my credit card number. I refused unless he could guarantee they'd apply the giftcard after the fact... he said he couldn't, but could transfer me to customer service. So, the fourth lady said that she could not help me either but could transfer me back to the giftcard people (who I'd already spoken to). Pulling my hair out and wishing I'd never bought the damn card. Going to try to sell it and cut my losses....<br /><br />NEVER DOING BUSINESS WITH HOTELS.COM AGAIN! Back to travelocity, where they at least have good customer service.",0.0,very negative,0

This (prepaid visa gift card has Nothing to do with my Bank) so after an hour of trying to get this resolved, I gave up, from looking at some of the other reviews I am not the only one that hates Amazon's new system, looks like they will be losing even more customers if this isn't taken care of, I have to agree with many of the other people, THIS REALLY SUCKS!!!!!",0.0,very negative,0

"Quick and easy.. This service is very handy for me as I am in the UK and my family is in the USA.  Saves all the trouble and expense of sending gifts through the not always reliable mail systems of our two countries.  I have used this Amazon gift card service before and it has always been absolutely spot on. There has never been any problem with the currency difference, it's all done by Amazon!  I have no hesitation in recommending this method of sending gifts as it has the additional benefit of the recipient being able to choose what to spend it on.",4.0,very positive,4

"I bought $150 gift card but it did not load on my account. Amazon Customer service failed to resolve. Beware:  I bought an Amazon gift card at a grocery store and tried loading it to my account, but it failed to load.  I called Amazon customer service four times and they never resolved it.  The first two Amazon associates I talked to on the phone escalated the case to a higher level customer service and provided $10 gift as a consolation for the several hours I spent on the phone and said it would be resolved once they looked into it more.  However, that never happened after talking with 2-3 more associates.  They declined to refund me the money and I am out $150.  Very disappointed in all the time they stole from me and the $150.  I am hoping things can still be resolved, but if not, and least I can write this review.  We will see if it posts...",0.0,very negative,0
